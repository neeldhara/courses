# About the Course

Card magic is a fascinating blend of mathematics, psychology, and performance art. In this short course, we'll explore some fundamental principles of card magic, focusing on mathematical techniques that create seemingly impossible effects. While the focus will be on self-working tricks and the math that drives them, we will also cover practical and presentation aspects of card magic.

# About the Instructor
<img src="ramprasad.jpg" alt="Prof. Ramprasad Saptharishi" class="instructor-image">
[Prof. Ramprasad Saptharishi](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~ramprasad/) is a faculty member in the School of Technology and Computer Science at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).

He completed his Ph.D. under the guidance of Manindra Agrawal from Chennai Mathematical Institute. Following his Ph.D., he was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India for a year, hosted by Neeraj Kayal and Satya Lokam. Subsequently, he was a post-doctoral fellow at Tel Aviv University hosted by Amir Shpilka before joining TIFR.

His academic interests are in pseudorandomness and derandomization, algebraic circuit complexity, and broadly anything with an algebraic flavour. He also happens to be a connoisseur and performer of card magic!

**Session 1: Introduction to Card Magic**

We'll start with the basics of card handling and some fundamental mathematical principles that underlie many card tricks. Topics include shuffle tracking, the Gilbreath principle, and basic probability in card magic.

**Session 2: Self-Working Card Tricks**

We now demonstrate some concrete card tricks that leverage the principles we saw so far. These tricks work automatically without sleight of hand. We'll work out how the principles from before support the magic in these tricks.
