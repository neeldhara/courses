Rock Papers Scissors\n\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\n\nYou are preparing for your first big RPS match. Someone has tipped you off with a strategy guide against your opponent on the first match, which consists of many rounds. The strategy guide can be interpreted as follows:\n\n- The first column of the i-th row is what your opponent is going to play in the i-th round: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. \n- The second column of the i-th row is what you should play in response in the i-th round: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. \n\nWinning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\n\nYour total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\n\nYour task is to calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\n\n\n### Input Format\n\nThe first line of the input is a number `N`, which is the total number of rounds. The next `N` lines contain two space separated characters. The first character is one of `A` or `B` or `C`, and the second character is one of `X` or `Y` or `Z`.\n\n### Output Format\n\nThe output shound be a single integer, your total score across all rounds based on the strategy guide.\n\n### Sample I/O\n\n\n`Sample Input`\n\n```default\n3\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\n```\n\n`Expected Output`\n\n```default\n15\n```\n\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\n- In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\n- In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).\n- The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n\nIn this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n# Problem 5.

Each test case is two lines. The first line is the value of **p(2)** and the second line is the value of **d**.\n\nIt is guaranteed that p(2) will be at most `10^9` and d will be at most the degree of p(x).\n\n### Output Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer on a new line, which is `YES` or `NO` depending on if the coefficient of **x^d** in p(x) is `1` or `0`.
