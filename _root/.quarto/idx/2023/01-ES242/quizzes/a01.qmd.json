The 15-Puzzle\n\nSuppose you are implementing the [15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) game:\n\n> This is a sliding puzzle having 15 square tiles numbered 1–15 in a frame that is 4 tiles high and 4 tiles wide, leaving one unoccupied tile position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles and place them in increasing numerical order.\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n![An Example 15-Puzzle Instance](q01-img01.png)\n\nYou decide to record the game state as a list of length 16, with elements between 0-15 (0 denotes the empty cell), using the following convention:\n\n1. the first four elements contain the numbers in the first row of the board, \n\n2. the fifth-eighth elements contain the numbers in the second row of the board, \n\n3. the ninth-twelfth elements contain the numbers in the third row of the board, and\n\n4. the thirteenth-sixteenth element csontain the numbers in the fourth row of the board.\n\n\nSuppose you generalise this to a game involving a $N \\times N$ board, using a list of size $N^2$. The user indicates how they want to move at every step. Assume you can directly access and update any element in your list. \n\nHow much time do you need to update the configuration?\n\n- proportional to $N$\n- proportional to $N^2$\n- constant\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-caution icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n# Solution\n\nSuppose the empty cell is at row $R$ (counting from the top; i.e, the top row is row $1$) and column $C$ (counting from the left; i.e, the left-most column is column $1$). The user may chose one of the following four moves:\n\n- move the number at row $R-1$ and column $C$ into the empty cell, provided $R$ is not the top row. \n- move the number at row $R$ and column $C-1$ into the empty cell, provided $C$ is not the left-most column.\n- move the number at row $R$ and column $C+1$ into the empty cell, provided $C$ is not the right-most column.\n- move the number at row $R+1$ and column $C$ into the empty cell, provided $R$ is not the bottom row.\n\nThe procedure to update the configuration involves two things:\n\n- identify the number to be moved into the empty slot based on the move chosen by the user;\n- update (swap) the values of the list at locations $(R-1)*N + (C-1)$^[This assumes 0-based indexing; the exact index _can_ be slightly different depending on convention.] and the location corresponding to the number to be moved.\n\nThese two steps require knowledge of $R$ and $C$, i.e, the location of the empty slot. Since we are given the contents of _all_ locations as a list, we may need to --- in the worst case --- go through the entire list to find where the `0`-element lies. \n\nNote that to speed things up, we could store the integers $R$ and $C$, representing the location of the `0`-element, separately: and update it as moves are made. With this approach, the update can be achieved in constant time.\n\nFor this question, no such assumption is made, so the time required to update the configuration is proportional to $N^2$ in the worst-case.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n# Problem 2. 2048\n\nSuppose you are implementing the [2048 game](https://play2048.co):\n\n> 2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.\n\nFeel free to play the game at the link above to get a feel for it. \n\nSuppose you are implementing a version of 2048 on a $N \\times N$ board, using a list of size $N^2$. As in the previous question, the list carries information about the state of the board: the first $N$ elements correspond to the numbers in the first row, and so on. The user indicates in which direction they want to move at every step.

Then: it must be that $j > i$ (since all men $m_j$ with $j < i$ are already matched to $w_j$).
