For example, consider a party where there are two groups of six people each: call these groups $X$ and $Y$. Suppose everyone in $X$ knows everyone in $Y$ and vice versa, but no pair of people in group $X$ know each other and no pair of people in $Y$ know each other either. Then there are $12$ people, each of whom give six gifts each, amounting to a total of $72$ gifts being given, which is more than $4n = 4 \\cdot 12 = 48$.\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n# Problem 2.
