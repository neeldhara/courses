A Boastful Cop vs a Clever Robber\n\nA robber is trying to escape a cop on an undirected graph G. In the beginning, the cop is at a vertex $s$ and the robber is at a vertex $t$. (You may assume that $s$ and $t$ are distinct.) They take turns making moves, and each knows the location of the other at all times. A move (by either of them) consists of either staying at the current vertex or moving to a neighbouring one.\n\nThe cop is boastful, so he announces his moves before making them. Specifically:\n\na. **before** anyone makes a move, the cop's first move is announced - so the robber knows where the cop is headed.\n\nb. Then, the robber makes an actual move.\n\nc. After this, each time the cop moves, he must respect the previous announcement (i.e, move to the previously announced vertex), and then decide his next move and announce it.\n\nd. The robber hears the announcements, so she always knows the cop's next move before making her own. She makes her move.\n\nIf the cop and the robber are at the same vertex after either of them moves, then the robber is caught. Otherwise, the chase is on!\n\nThe robber chooses her moves optimally to escape. If she cannot escape, she chooses her moves to maximize the total number of moves until she is caught. The cop chooses his moves optimally to try to catch the robber in as few total moves as possible.\n\nGiven the graph's layout and the initial locations of both the cop and the robber, find out whether robber will be caught by the cop and, if so, in how many moves. We say that the game is won by the robber if she's never caught, and by the cop otherwise.\n\nIn the figures below, the square vertex depicts the initial location of the robber, and the star depicts the initial location of the cop. Indicate what happens under optimal play. If you choose that the cop wins, indicate how many moves the game lasts assuming optimal play. Each move made by each player counts as a distinct move.\n\n1. **[2 marks]** Who wins? __________________\n\n    \n\n2. **[2 marks]** Who wins?  __________________\n\n    \n\n5. **[2 marks]** If the robber starts on a vertex that is a part of a cycle, then which of the following statements is true?\n\n    ⭕️ The robber wins this game.\n\n    ⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is equal to the length of the cycle.\n\n    ⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves is twice the length of the cycle.\n\n    ⭕️ The cop wins this game and the number of moves depends on the initial distance between the cop and the robber.\n\n    ⭕️ The outcome depends on where the cop starts.\n\n3. **[3 marks]** Suppose the game is being played on a  path (i.e, a graph with vertices $u_1, \\ldots, u_n$ and edges $(u_1,u_2), (u_2, u_3), \\cdots, (u_{n-1},u_n)$.

Preserving Fixed-Points while Sorting\n\n**[5 marks]** When an array is to be sorted, it may happen that some data values start out being in the same position where they should end up. For example, in the array which is originally: \n\n$$45,-4,32,0$$\n\nthe $32$ is right where it will be in the final sorted output:\n\n$$-4,0,32,45$$\n\nBut as a particular sorting algorithm operates, it might (depending on the algorithm) move such an element out of the position where it belongs and move it back eventually.\n\nLet's say that a sorting algorithm **respects fixedpoints** if it never moves an element that is in its proper position, on any input.\n\nConsider the following methods of sorting:\n\n*Selection sort.* The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\n\nEg: **4** 3 2 **1** → 1 **3** **2** 4 → 1 2 3 4\n\n*Insertion sort.* Insertion sort iterates over the array, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.\n\nEg: 4 **3** 2 1 → 3 4 **2** 1 → 2 3 4 **1** → 1 2 3 4\n\nWhich of the following statements are true?\n\n⭕️ Insertion sort does not respect fixedpoints but selection sort does.\n\n⭕️ Selection sort does not respect fixedpoints but insertion sort does.\n\n⭕️ Neither insertion sort nor selection sort respects fixed points.\n\n⭕️ Both insertion sort and selection sort respect fixed points.\n\nJustify your answer. If you claim that a particular sorting method does not respect fixed points, then give an example. If you claim that an algorithm does respect fixed points, argue why.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n# Problem 4. Eliminating Jealousy\n\nYou have distributed M objects among N children. The set of objects given to a child is called his or her **bundle**. Each child has a specific value for their bundle: let us say child $k$ has value $v_k$ for their bundle. Each child also has a value for all the other bundles: so let us say that child $k$ has value $v_{k,\\ell}$ for the bundle that was given to child $\\ell$.\n\nWe say that child $a$ **is jealous** of child $b$ if $v_{a,b} > v_a$, i.e, s/he values the bundle given to $b$ more than the bundle that s/he has.\n\nConsider the following directed graph $G$.
