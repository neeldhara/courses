We met at 10PM IST on all days during November, with three skips (one for Diwali, one for the CWC finals, and one because of technical issues). So we met for the first two days of December too, clocking in 29 total sessions, 26-ish hours, and 28 miniatures (two of them took two days, and we once covered two miniatures in one session). We tentatively plan to do a week-long reunion meet in January some time to discuss the five remaining miniatures (#28, #29, #31, #32, #33). The forum will remain open until then: please feel free to discuss while we take a break from the daily meetings!\n\n(01/11) We meet at 10PM IST.
