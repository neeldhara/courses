However, no formal resources tell us what research—an established path to great science and engineering—is all about, and how one can get started. As a result, many don’t end up figuring out these details, have no idea what the journey promises to offer, and as a consequence, move on to other well-documented jobs and careers. While there’s nothing wrong with taking up well-documented careers, academia and scholarship loses out on quality talent.\n\nIn another extreme, among those few who are exposed to the idea of research while still in undergrad, there exists a frenzy to apply to graduate programs by the end of undergrad. And to achieve this, students tend to optimize working on projects which will land them ‘the best possible’ publications and letters from professors. While few successfully discover their interests this way, it generally fails as an approach.\n\nThis course aims to fast-track the process of learning more about research-first graduate programs and/or jobs. It will nudge you to introspect whether problem solving and research is something you will enjoy, and provide some concrete steps for your discovery. It is not designed to merely provide instructions on applying successfully to graduate programs or advanced degrees. Rather, it aims to introduce you to the realities of doing research, which should in turn help you gauge your preparedness for graduate school or a career in research.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# About the Instructor\n\nShashank is currently a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the CS & AI Lab (CSAIL), in the department of Electrical engineering and Computer science (EECS) at MIT. He is advised by Una-May O'Reilly. His research interests are at the intersection of machine learning, program analysis, and cognitive neuroscience. He has published his work at top-tier academic venues and has authored multiple patents.\n\nPrior to his Ph.D. studies, he was a senior researcher at Aspiring Minds' research lab, where he helped build, deploy, and manage a number of innovative products involving machine learning. These products are used by >1M job applicants across the world today. In this role, he also helped organize international workshops, led academic collaborations, and helped set up communities in India to participate and engage in ML and data science (http://www.datasciencekids.org, http://ml-india.org).\n\nHe is also interested in governance, and science education and policy. To understand the nuances of how state governments deliver benefits to the last-mile, he worked with Seva Setu, an organization which aims to bridge the gap between governments and people, for a year in rural Bihar in India.\n\nDetails on his work can be found on [his webpage](https://shashank-srikant.github.io/). \n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# Dates and Time\n\n31st October – 5th November • Timing: 6:30PM to 8:30PM • Mode: Online (over Zoom)\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n# Target Audience\nThe course material is beginner-friendly: the only pre-requisite is a willingness to commit time and curiosity about research pursuits in computer science (broadly interpreted).\n\nThe course is designed for undergraduates in computer science and allied areas in any year looking to plan out their first or second research projects, however, participation is not restricted and all are welcome.\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n# Methodology\n\nThe course will be taught over Zoom and will involve several hands-on assignments.

We introduce some common set of skills every researcher benefits from—taking initiative, reading and writing code, knowing domain-specific tools, parsing papers, communicating over email, and presenting your work. Also learn about the balances you will likely have to strike as you go along, and prepare with us for battles like imposter syndrome or loneliness you may face.\n\n3.
