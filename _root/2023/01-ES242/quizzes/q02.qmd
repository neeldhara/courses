# Problem 1. Doubly Linked Lists

If `p` is the address of a node in a doubly linked list `L`, then:

- `next(p)` is the address of the next node in the linked list 
- `prev(p)` is the address of the previous node in the linked list 
- `data(p)` is the information contained in the the node at address `p`

Note that:

- if `p` is the address of the first node in `L` then `prev(p)` is `NULL`.
- if `p` is the address of the last node in `L` then `next(p)` is `NULL`.

Also,  `data(p)`, `next(p)` and `prev(p)` returns a sensible value only if `p` is not `NULL`, otherwise they are `UNDEFINED`.

If `L` is a linked list with five elements and `p` is the address of the third element, then what does `next(prev(next(next(p))))` represent?

- Address of the 1st element
- Address of the 2nd element
- Address of the 3rd element
- Address of the 4th element
- Address of the 5th element
- `UNDEFINED`

If `L` is a linked list with five elements and `p` is the address of the third element, then what does `data(prev(prev(next(p))))` represent?

- Data of the 1st element
- Data of the 2nd element
- Data of the 3rd element
- Data of the 4th element
- Data of the 5th element
- `UNDEFINED`

# Problem 2. Adjacency Lists

Suppose $A$ is the adjacency matrix of a simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices given by $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, that is, 

$$
    A[i,j] =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } (i,j) \in E,\\
      0 & \text{if } (i,j) \notin E.
    \end{cases}
$$

Note that $A[i,i] = 0$ for all $i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ since $G$ is simple.

Suppose $(i,j) \in E$ for some $i,j \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, $i \neq j$. Let $k$ denote the number of vertices that are adjacent to _both_ $i$ and $j$.

What is the value of $A^2[i,j]$?

- $0$
- $1$
- $k$
- $k+1$

# Problem 3. Edge List

Suppose every vertex of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has $d$ neighbors.

What is the size of the edge list?

- $d \cdot n$
- $d \cdot n/2$
- $2d \cdot n$
- $(d + n)$

Is it possible that both $d$ and $n$ are odd?

- Yes
- No
