# Problem 1A. How did they do it?

Imagine a friend gives you a deck of cards and lets you shuffle it a few times. They then ask vou to deal out the top 26 cards face down, which divides the deck into two. 

You keep one half and they take the other. They ask you to count how many red cards you have. In the meantime, you notice that they are silently looking through their own half of the deck. But whatever they are doing they did it as quickly as you, because once you're done they declare that they know how many red cards you counted, and correctly announce the answer! 

How did they do it?

# Problem 3. Chessboard Game

Alice begins by marking a corner square of an n Ã— n chessboard; Bob marks an orthogonally adjacent square. 

Thereafter, Alice and Bob continue alternating. each marking a square adjacent to the last one marked, until no unmarked adjacent square is available at which time the player whose turn it is to play loses.

For which n does Alice have a winning strategy? For which n does she win if the first square marked is instead a neighbor of a corner square?

Hint: dominoes.
