# Problem 1. Set Cover: The Greedy Bound is Tight

We argued in class that the greedy approach to solving the unweighted Set Cover problem achieves an approximation ratio of $O(H_n)$. Argue that this bound is tight, i.e, come up with examples where the algorithm picks sets in a manner that the cost of the solution is roughly $H_n$ worse than optimal.

# Problem 2. Set Cover and Related Problems

1. Show that Vertex Cover is a special case of Set Cover. 

2. Also show that Dominating Set and Set Cover are equivalent (i.e, Set Cover can be reduced to Dominating Set and vice versa).
