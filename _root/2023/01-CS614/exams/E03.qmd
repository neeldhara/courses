# EXACT MATCH (3 points)

Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the EXACT MATCH problem asks for an _induced_ matching of size $k$, that is, $k$ edges $x_1 y_1, \ldots, x_k y_k$ such that the $2k$ endpoints are all distinct and there is no edge between $\left\{x_i, y_i\right\}$ and $\left\{x_j, y_j\right\}$ for any $i \neq j$.

Prove that EXACT MATCH parameterized by $k$ is as hard as INDEPENDENT SET parameterized by $k$.

# Dominating Set on Restricted Classes

Consider the Dominating Set problem.

:::{.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="true"}

# Problem 2.1 Understanding graph classes (1 point)


Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the graphs _excluding_ the star $K_{1,4}$ as an **induced** subgraph. That is, a graph $G$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ if and only if there is no copy of a star on four leaves as an induced subgraph (but you may still have vertices of degree four or more).

Similarly, let $\mathcal{B}$ be the graphs _excluding_ the star $K_{1,2}$ as an **induced** subgraph.

Which of the following is true?

- $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$
- $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$
- neither of the above

# Problem 2.2 An Easy Case (2 points)
 

Can you solve Dominating Set in polynomial time if your input graph does not contain the star $K_{1,2}$ as an induced subgraph?

# Problem 2.3 A Hard Case (4 points)


Prove that Dominating Set restricted to graphs excluding the star $K_{1,4}$ as an induced subgraph is as hard as Dominating Set on general graphs. 

_Hint: look up the textbook (Theorem 13.15) reduction for Connected Dominating Set and adapt it._

# PERMUTATION COMPOSITION (3 points)

The EXACT UNIQUE HITTING SET problem is the following:

Input: A universe $U$, a set $A$ of subsets of $U$, and an integer $k$.
Question: Does there exist a set $X \subseteq U$ of size exactly $k$ such that $|A \cap X|=1$ for every $A \in A$?

In the PERMUTATION COMPOSITION problem, the input consists of a family $\mathcal{P}$ of permutations of a finite universe $U$, additional permutation $\pi$ of $U$, and an integer $k$, and the question is whether one can find a sequence $\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_k \in \mathcal{P}$ such that:

$$\pi=\pi_1 \circ \pi_2 \circ \ldots \circ \pi_k.$$

Show a reduction from EXACT UNIQUE HITTING SET to PERMUTATION COMPOSITION.

# NICE SUBSET (3 points)

Let $G=\left(X, Y, E\right)$ be an undirected bipartite graph, that is, a graph whose nodes are divided into two sets, $X$ and $Y$, such that every edge in $E$ connects a node in $X$ to a node in $Y$. The nodes in $X$ are all labeled with non-negative integers.

Some of the nodes in $Y$ can be removed to leave a subset $W \subseteq Y$. A subset $W$ is called nice with $G$ if every node in $X$ which has been assigned a number $m$ is connected to exactly $m$ nodes in $W$. An example of a nice set is in the image below.

The problem is to determine whether a nice $W$ exists. Demonstrate a reduction from 3SAT to this problem.
