Prompts for discussion:

There is a lot to be said about Kakeya sets that we did not get into at all due to time constraints. I was hoping to be able to locate an interactive construction of the Perron tree to share here, but I couldn't find one. For now, the miniature has a nice description of it, as does [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakeya_set).

Here's a discussion potentially of interest, about explicit constructions of [Kakeya sets over finite fields](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4226401/algorithm-for-generating-kakeya-sets-in-finite-fields).
