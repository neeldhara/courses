Prompts for discussion:

1. The proof for the bound on the number of *equidistant* points was borrowed from [this answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2623156). 

2. A natural question seems to be: what about three distances? Or $n$ points and $k$ distinct distances?

3. What the number of points where one distance is seen at most $p$ times and the other is seen at most $q$ times? In particular, I was wondering if we could get to an "almost one distance" situation by saying that the "other distance" does not manifest frequently.
