Prompts for discussion:

1. [Here's the other proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ByCnuCbPsg) that I think is a little more transparent in its approach to the final claim (it's also the proof featured on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%E2%80%93Pollak_theorem) for the theorem).

2. Here's the [OG reference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6768978), which has more context on the problem, and a proof involving eigenvalues and determinants, so enjoy looking that up! :slight_smile: 

3. Just to record the question(s) that came up during discussion: can you show that $n-1$ is always enough? In how many ways can you do it with $n-1$ parts? What's the total number of partitions, with any number of (non-empty) parts?
