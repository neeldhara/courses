Prompts for discussion:

1. The odd town rules can be thought of as (odd,even); reflecting the parity constraints on the sizes of the clubs and the sizes of the pairwise intersections, respectively. What about other towns with (odd,odd), (even,odd), and (even, even)? What bounds do we get? Are they tight?

2. What about generalized constraints of the form $\equiv p \mod q$?
