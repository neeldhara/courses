Prompts for discussion:

1. Work out the "pedestrian proof" of the nonsingularity of $B$.

2. Recover the [De Bruijn–Erdős](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(incidence_geometry)) theorem as a special case of the generalized Fisher inequality:

   >Let $P$ be a configuration of $n$ points in a projective plane, not all on a line. Let $t$ be the number of lines determined by $P$. Then,
   >
   >- $t \geqslant n$, and
   >- if $t = n$, any two lines have exactly one point of $P$ in common. In this case, $P$ is either a projective plane or $P$ is a near pencil, meaning that exactly $n - 1$ of the points are collinear.

Here's the [combinatorial proof of Fisher's inequality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06286.pdf) mentioned during the discussion.
