Prompts for discussion:

Zeckendorf [showed that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem) each non-negative integer has a unique representation as a sum of Fibonacci numbers in which no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers occur. This observation leads to a numeral system. A natural question for a numeral system is how can we perform arithmetic operations on numbers in such a system, and how fast can we do it.

In particular:

- Can you add and subtract $n$-digit numbers in the Zeckendorf system in $O(n)$ time, as fast as in the binary system?

- Can you multiply $n$-digit numbers in the Zeckendorf system in $O(n \log n)$ time, as fast as in the binary system?
