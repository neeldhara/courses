Prompts for discussion:

1. We spent time on the determinant of the Laplacian of a graph here (short of one vertex). Is there a structural interpretation of the determinant of the adjacency matrix? There are some thoughts [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/134956/determinants-in-graph-theory).

2. Graham and Pollak showed that the determinant of the distance matrix of a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices - the $n \times n$ matrix whose each $(v, w) \in V(T) \times V(T)$ entry is the ordinary graph distance between $v$ and $w$-depends only on $n$. In fact, they gave a formula: $-(n-1)(-2)^{n-2}$. I thought this was really neat: the determinant seems to be completely independent of the structure of the tree! ðŸ¤¯
