Prompts for discussion:

1. Confirm that the positive semidefinite criteria indeed turns out to be the familiar triangle inequality constraints when $n = 2$.

2. Can you explain the criteria of the theorem in geometric terms for higher dimensions?

Here's the link to the [Geogebra applet](https://www.geogebra.org/m/mfmxqzww) showing the triangle inequality, and here's a [slightly nicer one](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/cqbs9uwv) that lets you set the three distances and see the two circles come together or become disjoint depending on whether or not you violate one of the triangle inequalities.
