Prompts for discussion:

1. We did not get into it much, but cages have been extensively studied and are also pretty! See [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CageGraph.html), for example. 

2. Also, [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09577) is the latest that I could find indicating that the "maybe 57" issue remains open. [Here](https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/DS14) is a fairly extensive survey.
