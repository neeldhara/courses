Prompts for discussion:

1. Define a $\ell$-safe walk to be a walk that involves stepping out of the safe region at most $\ell$ times (where stepping out involves going out of the safe region and coming back into the safe region in the very next step). The theorem we saw was for $\ell$-safe walks with $d = 0$. For $d = 1$, can we prove a similar result with a smaller safe region?

2. It would be nice to find out about the improved bounds known in two dimensions.
