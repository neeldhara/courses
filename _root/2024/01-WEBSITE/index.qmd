### Teaching Plan

---

On the first day, we will go over:

1. Website styles: personal blog, resume, knowledge gardens, etc.
2. Websites we love: case studies
3. Hosting and setup: main options
4. Planning your content
5. Aesthetics
6. Accessibility and Security
7. Auxiliary platforms 

On the second day, we will discuss and get feedback on websites that participants have made.

### Before the Workshop

Answer the following questions:

0. What is the goal of your website? Who is the target audience? What do you think they are looking for?
1. What kind of content would you like to share on your website?
2. What features do you want your website to have?
3. What are some of the websites that you have found useful and think of as model examples for your own?
4. What is your degree of comfort with writing code and basic scripting? 
5. Come up with a basic content plan for your website: what elements will the navigation have, and have a summary of what you want each page to contain.

Please share a Google Doc with answers to these questions by Friday 5PM. This will help me fine-tune to the workshop to your needs.
