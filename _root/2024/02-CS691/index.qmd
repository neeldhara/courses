## Applications of Linear Algebra

##### Summer 2024

:::{.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}

##### About the Course

This course explores applications of tools from linear algebra in combinatorics, geometry, algorithms, and graph theory. We will emphasize proofs and proof techniques. The goal is to use the applications as a backdrop to practice and review linear algebra skills, but also to develop a an understanding of new proof techniques and recognize how to apply them in new settings as well.

##### Target Audience

Logsitically, this course is a special summer offering meant for advanced students of the IITM online BS program in Data Science and undergraduate students of IIT Gandhinagar. Anyone with a background in linear algebra and an interest in the material is welcome to follow along.

##### Prerequisites
A little linear algerba won't hurt. Try starting here if you have never encountered linear algebra concepts before:

1. [The Linear Algebra course on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
2. [The 3blue1brown Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&v=fNk_zzaMoSs&embeds_referring_euri=https://linearalgebra33.discourse.group/&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE) on the "Essence of Linear Algebra"
3. [An interactive introduction](https://brilliant.org/landing/interactive-courses-learn-linear-algebra/) from Brilliant.
